Feature: requirement_2
  In order to view the papers that are associated with a specific last name
  As a user
  I need to be able to generate a word cloud of the names of papers when I search for a last name

  Scenario: Searching for a specific last name that does have corresponding papers in IEEE and ACM libraries # features/requirement_2.feature:6

    Then a label is shown where the word cloud would be that there are no papers for this user     # FeatureContext::aLabelIsShownWhereTheWordCloudWouldBeThatThereAreNoPapersForThisUser()

  Scenario: Changing the number of papers, X, to be shown before searching returns a word cloud with exactly that many papers # features/requirement_2.feature:14
    Given X is set to 20 before searching                                                                                     # FeatureContext::xIsSetToBeforeSearching()
    Then number of papers in the word cloud is 20                                                                             # FeatureContext::numberOfPapersInTheWordCloudIs()

Feature: requirement_3 Paper List Sorting

    When a word in the Paper Cloud is clicked                                                    # FeatureContext::wordInThePaperCloudClicked()
    Then the paper list is displayed                                                             # FeatureContext::paperListDisplayed()

  Scenario: Sorting the paper list in ascending order of the "Title" Column    # features/requirement_3.feature:11
    Given the paper list is generated for the "Title" column                   # FeatureContext::thePaperListGeneratedForTitleColumn()
    When the "Title" column header is clicked                                  # FeatureContext::titleColumnHeaderClicked()
    Then the paper list is sorted in the ascending order of the "Title" column # FeatureContext::paperListsortInAscendingOrderOfTitleColumn()

  Scenario: Sorting the paper list in ascending order of the "Author" Column    # features/requirement_3.feature:16
    Given the paper list is generated for the "Author" column                   # FeatureContext::thePaperListGeneratedForAuthorColumn()
    When the "Author" column header is clicked                                  # FeatureContext::authorColumnHeaderClicked()
    Then the paper list is sorted in the ascending order of the "Author" column # FeatureContext::paperListsortInAscendingOrderOfAuthorColumn()

  Scenario: Sorting the paper list in ascending order of the "Conference" Column    # features/requirement_3.feature:21
    Given the paper list is generated for the "Conference" column                   # FeatureContext::thePaperListGeneratedForConferenceColumn()
    When the "Conference" column header is clicked                                  # FeatureContext::conferenceColumnHeaderClicked()
    Then the paper list is sorted in the ascending order of the "Conference" column # FeatureContext::paperListsortInAscendingOrderOfConferenceColumn()

  Scenario: Sorting the paper list in ascending order of the "Frequency" Column    # features/requirement_3.feature:26
    Given the paper list is generated for the "Frequency" column                   # FeatureContext::thePaperListGeneratedForFrequencyColumn()
    When the "Frequency" column header is clicked                                  # FeatureContext::frequencyColumnHeaderClicked()
    Then the paper list is sorted in the ascending order of the "Frequency" column # FeatureContext::paperListsortInAscendingOrderOfFrequencyColumn()

Feature: requirement_4 Full Text Link
  In order to view the actual text of each paper from the paper list
  As a user
  I need to be able to see a download link for each paper in the paper list

  Scenario: each paper has a link for its full text              # features/requirement_4.feature:6
    Given the paper list is generated for the "Full Text" column # FeatureContext::givenPaperListGeneratedForFullTextColumn()
    Then the paper list contains a "Full Text" column            # FeatureContext::thenPaperListContainsFullTextColumn()
    Then each paper has a link for its full text                 # FeatureContext::thenEachPaperHasLinkForItsFullText()
