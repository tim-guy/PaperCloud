Refactorings result in global changes and lead to merge conflicts. A refactoring-aware SCM system reduces merge conflicts, preserves program history better and makes it easier to understand program evolution. This paper describes MolhadoRef a refactoring-aware SCM system and the merge algorithm at its core. MolhadoRef records change operations (refactorings and edits) used to produce one version, and replays them when merging versions. Since refactorings are change operations with well defined semantics, MolhadoRef treats them intelligently. A case-study shows that MolhadoRef solves automatically more merge conflicts than CVS while resulting in fewer merge errors.","keywords":"Refactoring-Aware Configuration Management for Object-Oriented Programs object-oriented programming software engineering History Java Manuals Merging Programming profession Runtime Scattering Software algorithms Software engineering"},{"source":"ieee","title":"High frequency applications of intrinsic Josephson junctions in mesa structures on Bi\/sub 2\/Sr\/sub 2\/CaCu\/sub 2\/O\/sub 8+y\/ single crystals","authors":"G.

Tunnel ionization has been investigated as a way for the beam itself to create the plasma, and the wakes generated may differ from those generated in pre-ionized plasmas[2],[3]. However, it is not practical to model the whole stage of PWFA with afterburner parameters using the models described in [2] and [3]. Here we describe the addition of a tunnel ionization package using the ADK model into QuickPIC, a highly efficient quasi-static particle in cell (PIC) code which can model a PWFA with afterburner parameters. Comparison between results from OSIRIS (a full PIC code with ionization) and from QuickPIC with the ionization package shows good agreement. Preliminary results using parameters relevant to the E164X experiment and the upcoming E167 experiment at SLAC are shown.","keywords":"Modeling Self-Ionized Plasma Wakefield Acceleration for Afterburner Parameters Using Quickpic Incineration Ion accelerators Ionization Packaging Particle beams Plasma accelerators Plasma applications Plasma density Plasma simulation Plasma sources"},{"source":"ieee","title":"A Ph.D. Curriculum for Digital Forensics","authors":"F.

Electrodeposition continues to be a complex deposition technique that can lead to low-quality material regions (crack) in the semiconductor material. Such cracks form porous zones on the substrate and diminish the heterojunction interface quality of a photovoltaic (PV) cell. In this paper, electrodeposition of In<sub>2<\/sub>S<sub>3<\/sub> films was systematically and quantitatively investigated by varying the electrodeposition parameters including bath composition, current density, deposition time, and deposition temperature. Their effects upon the film growth mechanism, composition, and morphology were studied with the help of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and fracture and buckling software (digital image analysis). In addition, the effect of different glass-substrates (Mo, ITO, and FTO) and annealing treatments upon the performance of the electrodeposited In<sub>2<\/sub>S<sub>3<\/sub> film was analyzed. Furthermore, the Taguchi Method was used to determine the optimal electrodeposition parameters and study their influence upon the morphological and compositional properties of In<sub>2<\/sub>S<sub>3<\/sub> films.","keywords":"Morphological and compositional analysis of electrodeposited indium (III) sulfide (In<inf>2<\/inf>S<inf>3<\/inf>) films Taguchi methods X-ray spectroscopy current density electrodeposition indium compounds scanning electron microscopy semiconductor materials solar cells thin films Current density Films Indium Indium tin oxide Morphology Substrates"},{"source":"ieee","title":"Development of Digital Environment IdentiTY (DEITY) System for Online Access","authors":"Johnson I.

This research compares information acquisition behavior for choice tasks using Mouselab, a computerized process tracing tool, and Eyegaze, an eye tracking system. In a paired difference experiment using apartment selection tasks and gambles, we found significant differences in information search patterns and subsequent choice behavior contingent upon the process tracing method. Overall, computerized process tracing tools increase the amount of effort needed to acquire information compared with eye tracking equipment. Our results show that subjects adopt information acquisition strategies to cope with the increased effort. These strategies tend to be more rigorous and systematic than those observed with eye tracking equipment. Thus, computerized process tracing tools fundamentally alter the information processing behavior they are believed to track unobtrusively by limiting the ability of the decision maker to adapt their information processing behavior dynamically to the demands of the data. Additional research is needed to explore the magnitude and consequences of these differences","keywords":"A comparison of two process tracing methods for choice tasks decision support systems human factors mouse controllers (computers) Cognition Computer displays Computerized monitoring Decision making Decision support systems Electronic commerce Frequency Information analysis Information processing Prototypes"},{"source":"ieee","title":"Object Recognition and Sensitive Periods: A Computational Analysis of Visual Imprinting","authors":"Randall C.

Evidence from a variety of methods suggests that a localized portion of the domestic chick brain, the intermediate and medial hyperstriatum ventrale (IMHV), is critical for object recognition. We have developed a neural network model of translation-invariant object recognition that incorporates features of the neural circuitry of IMHV, and exhibits behavior qualitatively similar to a range of findings in the filial imprinting paradigm. We derive several counter-intuitive behavioral predictions that depend critically upon the biologically derived features of the model. In particular, we propose that the recurrent excitatory and lateral inhibitory circuitry in the model, and observed in IMHV, produces hysteresis on the activation state of the units in the model and the principal excitatory neurons in IMHV. Hysteresis, when combined with a simple Hebbian covariance learning mechanism, has been shown in this and earlier work (F&#246;ldi&#225;k 1991; O'Reilly and McClelland 1992) to produce translation-invariant visual representations. The hysteresis and learning rule are responsible for a sensitive period phenomenon in the network, and for a series of novel temporal blending phenomena. These effects are empirically testable. Further, physiological and anatomical features of mammalian visual cortex support a hysteresis-based mechanism, arguing for the generality of the algorithm.","keywords":"Object Recognition and Sensitive Periods: A Computational Analysis of Visual Imprinting"}]
